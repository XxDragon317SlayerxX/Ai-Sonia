# Ai-Sonia
Ai Sonia is a project that a few 13 year olds are working on to help further our understanding of python. It is a personal assistant that can make store information that the user enters into a .txt file. We are currently working on other functions, and we would love for you to put suggestions in the Suggestions.txt file.
